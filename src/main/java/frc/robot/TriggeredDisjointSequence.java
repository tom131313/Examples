Usage:

good example with best practice of using command factories
Command test = TriggeredDisjointSequence.sequence(
    mySubsystem.test1(),
    mySubsystem.test2(),
    mySubsystem.test3(),
    mySubsystem.test4(),
    mySubsystem.test1()); // fresh Command from its factory so it doesn't conflict with other one
test.schedule();

bad example of the pitfall of not using command factories
Command test = TriggeredDisjointSequence.sequence(
    test1,
    test2,
    test3,
    test4,
    // reusing command test1 (which is NOT a best practice) so it has to be
    // removed from the WrapperCommand group
    runOnce(()->CommandScheduler.getInstance().removeComposedCommand(test1)),
    test1);
test.schedule();

/**
