/*
 * Example of a subsystem that uses a (PID) controller to achieve a goal (setpoint).
 * 
 * There are several possible ways to implement this function.
 * 
 * Some teams use the structure of a perpetually running subsystem or other class that is the
 * controller that periodically updates. No commands are used to calculate or schedule
 * calculations. It responds to commands only to accept the goal (setpoint). There are a few ways
 * the periodic update can be scheduled:
 * 
 *  use the Subsystem.periodic() method (not recommended and may be deprecated sometime),
 * 
 *  inject the Robot.addPeriodic() method (allows update faster or slower than the normal loop but
 *  is hard to specify exactly where to sync with other commands - run first is nearly precise but
 *  run last is only approximated),
 * 
 *  use team supplied runBeforeCommands() and runAfterCommands() methods surrounding the
 *  Robot.CommandScheduler.getInstance() method.
 * 
 * Those goal-setting commands or other schemes needed in the above controllers may or may not be
 * protected by use of their own subsystem.
 * 
 * The above schemes might not be fully in the spirit of command-based so this example is not
 * encouraging that usage.
 * 
 * There are few ways to run a controller scheduled from the Command Loop.
 * 
 * The default command will run perpetually if there is no other overriding command issued. That
 * default command can encompass the controller and manage the goal setting (setpoint). The default
 * command has an advantage of automatically restarting if interrupted for any reason.
 * 
 * A normal command can run perpetually and encompass the controller and manage the goal (setpoint).
 * Normal commands do not restart if interrupted (unless some periodic monitoring process is added
 * such as a default command or Robot.periodic() method to restart the interrupted command).
 * 
 * The best alternative to all the above schemes usually is a controller is run by command when it
 * is needed.
 * 
 * A suggestion by CD @Amicus1 for those against using commands except to set the goal:
 * "If this is a verbosity of code issue, I suggest writing the logic as a private subsystem method
 * and exposing it as a command factory."
 * 
 * That is the bulk of the controller does not have to be coded "inline" making a very long command.
 * The logic of the controller doesn't even have to be within a command or subsystem but can reside
 * in its own class. The example of using a PID controller in this example subsystem works like
 * that. The WPILib PIDController is an essentially independent class with all the PID logic. It is
 * used by a command that accepts a setpoint and calls the appropriate calculation and setpoint
 * methods. The command and thus the calculations run continuously to the goal as they are needed.
 * 
 * In this example another command runs perpetually to display on LEDs the continuous output LED
 * pattern from the PID controller.
 * 
 * Thus, this example of PID controller to reach a goal of a selected color is actually a
 * combination of two of the above command-based periodic schemes.
 * 
 * First, a WPILib PID controller class is used on demand of a command to converge to the selected
 * color. The iterative command loop paces the calculations.
 * 
 * Second, the display of the progress of the PID controller calculations to achieve
 * the selected color is by a continuously running command that was scheduled when the robot code
 * started. That command displays the color to be displayed at each iteration of the command loop.
 * In this particular complex example the code was a bit cleaner with the LED color display running
 * essentially hidden in the background without the additional parallel command surrounding the
 * controller command with to simultaneously display on the LEDs.
 * 
 * The advantage of a "hidden" command is it is more modular with simpler modules. The disadvantage
 * is you don't see the whole picture as readily and forget the proper use of a hidden function.
