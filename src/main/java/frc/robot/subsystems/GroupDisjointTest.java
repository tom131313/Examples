/*
 * Sample program to demonstrate loose coupling of Commands in a sequential grouping. (Each leg of
 * any parallel grouping is also considered a sequence and that is especially obvious if a default
 * command runs after the primary command ends.)
 *
 * A standard sequence locks all of the requirements of all of the subsystems used in
 * the group for the duration of the sequential execution. Default commands do not run
 * until the entire sequence completes.
 *
 * A loosely connected sequential group demonstrates that each command runs independently and when
 * a command ends its subsystems' default commands run.
 *
 * Running the same sequence normally demonstrates that the subsystems' requirements are maintained
 * for the entire group execution duration and the default commands are not activated until the
 * sequence group ends.
 * 
 * Note that this class didn't have to be a subsystem for correct results under expected
 * circumstances. In the spirit of "things can go wrong that shouldn't" and "use a good practice
 * instead of a bad practice" this class was made a subsystem to be safe and demonstrate some
 * pitfalls of disjoint sequences.
 * 
 * An expectation of these tests is only one test job runs at a time. The scheduler does prevent
 * the same command from running more than once at the same time. Subsystem usage is not required
 * for that protection feature.
 * 
 * If a command was duplicated, the two copies could run at the same time since they appear as
 * different commands. In that case the use of subsystem requirements is needed to prevent
 * simultaneous runs.
 * 
 * The three subsystems being used for tests have been disjointed as that is the point of these
 * tests. Their requirements would not prevent copies of the entire test job from running at the
 * same time. To treat the entire test job as one transaction a requirement must be made of the
 * complete command. Using this subsystem as a requirement on the runOnce commands locks in the
 * entire job as a single entity when it is run as proxy disjoint sequence. If this class isn't a
 * subsystem, then the runOnce doesn't have the automatically provided requirement. The default is
 * no requirement and a requirement must be manually provided. That is prone to errors of omission
 * at the least.
 * 
 * The use of a subsystem requirement as described above only works if the sequence of jobs is
 * disjointed by proxy and not by triggering. Triggered sequence is highly disjointed with
 * essentially no communication between the individual commands and no group behavior validation.
 * Putting a requirement on the sequence actually is applied to only the first command and all the
 * rest of the commands are independent.
 * 
 * Using a subsystem or not and using triggered sequencing instead of proxies all give essentially
 * identical results within one (more or less) loop iteration. The major differences are in the
 * security provided by subsystems and command group membership.
 * 
 * (run(), runOnce(), startEnd(), runEnd(), and defer() within a subsystem automatically include
 * the subsystem as a requirements so you won't forget it. Usage outside of the subsystem defaults
 * to no requirements and any needed requirements must be manually entered.)
